## Ways to test the RESTFul Fibonacci service:

### Functional testing:
1.	Negative Cases
	- Fib n <= 0
	- Fib n > 100000
	- Fib n is not a number
	- Wrong URL
2.	Positive Cases
	- Fib 10
	- Fib 100
	- Fib 1000


### None functional testing:
1.	Service Performance testing
	- Stress Testing (Throughput, Latency)
2.	Fibonacci calculating performance
	- Fib n > 100000
3.	Tiredness testing
	- Run a continuous testing for a week or more time
4.	Security Testing
	- With auth-token
	- Without auth-token
