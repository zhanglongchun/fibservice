## Fibservice

A RESTful Fibonacci service

1. to support a REST GET call.
  - The web service accepts a number, n, as input and returns the first n Fibonacci numbers, starting from 0. I.e. given n = 5, appropriate output would represent the sequence "0 1 1 2 3".
  - Given a negative number, it will respond with an appropriate error.
